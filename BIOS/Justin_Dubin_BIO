Hello, my name is Justin Dubin! I am a Junior in Computing with a concentration in Information Systems. 
I am proficient in C#, and can quickly learn other types of programming languages. 
I have plentiful experience working with teams, both in coding projects as well as in other types of projects.
With teams, I have used many different types of collaboration software, and can adjust as needed to use what is best for a team.
In teams I often am the one ensuring things stay organized and on schedule, I believe I could take the roll of project manager.
I have given presentations about project statuses, although less formal and not related to software engineering.
